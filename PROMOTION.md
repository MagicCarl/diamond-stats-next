# My Baseball Stats - Promotion Guide

One-time $39 youth baseball stats app. No subscriptions. The target audience is **parents, coaches, and team managers** of youth and amateur baseball teams.

---

## 1. Social Media (Free)

### Facebook
- **Youth baseball parent groups** - Search "youth baseball [your city/state]" and join local groups. Answer questions about stat tracking and mention the app when relevant. Don't just spam links — be helpful first.
- **Travel ball / tournament groups** - Parents in competitive travel ball are the most likely buyers. Groups like "Travel Baseball Parents" and regional tournament groups are goldmines.
- **Little League groups** - Many local Little League organizations have Facebook groups for parents.
- **Create a Facebook Page** for My Baseball Stats. Post short demo videos, stat tips, and testimonials.

### Instagram / TikTok
- Short screen recordings showing live scoring in action at a real game (15-30 seconds).
- "Did you know?" posts about baseball stats (what is OPS, why OBP matters more than batting average, etc.).
- Before/after: paper scorebook vs. the app.
- Use hashtags: `#youthbaseball` `#littleleague` `#travelball` `#baseballmom` `#baseballdad` `#baseballcoach` `#baseballstats`

### X (Twitter)
- Follow and engage with youth baseball accounts, coaches, and baseball parent communities.
- Share tips and link back to the app.

### Reddit
- **r/Homeplate** - The main amateur baseball subreddit. Very relevant audience.
- **r/littleleague** - Directly your target market.
- **r/baseball** - Occasional relevant threads about scoring/stats.
- Reddit hates self-promotion. Contribute genuinely, and mention the app only when someone asks for stat-tracking recommendations.

## 2. Baseball Forums & Communities (Free)

- **Pair of discussions on youth baseball forums**: Sites like YouthBaseballParents.com, HSBBWEB.com (high school baseball web), and BaseballFever.com have active communities.
- **GameChanger / iScore alternative threads** - People regularly search for alternatives to subscription-based apps. Position My Baseball Stats as the "buy it once" alternative.
- **Coach-focused communities** - Coaches who are tired of paying monthly fees for stat apps are your best leads.

## 3. Direct Outreach (Free)

### Local Leagues
- Contact your local Little League, PONY, Cal Ripken, Babe Ruth, and USSSA league directors.
- Offer to demo the app at a board meeting or coaches clinic.
- Ask if they'll include a mention in their league newsletter or website.

### Travel Ball Organizations
- Travel ball coaches and team managers are power users who track stats obsessively.
- Reach out to local travel ball organizations and offer a free trial or demo.

### Tournaments
- Tournament directors often have websites and social media. Ask about sponsorship or advertising on their pages.
- If you attend tournaments, show the app to other parents in the stands — word of mouth is powerful.

## 4. Content Marketing (Free, Time Investment)

### Blog Posts / Articles
Add a `/blog` section to the site (or use a free platform like Medium/Substack) and write posts like:
- "How to Keep Score at a Youth Baseball Game"
- "Understanding Your Kid's Baseball Stats: AVG, OBP, SLG Explained"
- "Why OBP Matters More Than Batting Average for Youth Players"
- "Travel Ball Stats: What Coaches Look For"
- "Paper Scorebook vs. App: Which Is Better?"

These rank well in Google because parents search for this stuff constantly.

### YouTube
- Screen recording walkthrough of scoring a game live.
- "How to use spray charts to improve your hitting."
- Tutorial-style content that naturally showcases the app.

## 5. SEO (Free, Already Started)

You already have metadata, sitemap, robots.txt, and structured data in place. Additional steps:
- Target long-tail keywords: "youth baseball stats app," "little league scoring app," "baseball stats tracker no subscription."
- Make sure the landing page copy includes natural keyword phrases.
- Get backlinks by being listed on baseball resource pages, app directories, and league websites.
- Add alt text to all images on the landing page.

## 6. Paid Advertising (Budget-Dependent)

### Facebook/Instagram Ads
- **Best ROI for this product.** You can target parents of kids aged 6-18 who are interested in baseball, Little League, travel ball, etc.
- Start with $5-10/day. A short video ad showing live scoring works best.
- Retarget people who visited the site but didn't purchase.

### Google Ads
- Target keywords like "youth baseball stats app," "baseball scoring app," "little league stats tracker."
- These are low-competition keywords, so cost-per-click should be cheap.
- The "no subscription" angle is a strong differentiator in ad copy.
