  {
    q: "Is scoring softball different from scoring baseball?",
    a: "The symbols and position numbers are identical, so anything you learned for baseball transfers directly. The differences are structural: softball games are usually 7 innings instead of 9, many leagues bat more players (or the whole roster), fastpitch uses a Designated Player (DP) and Flex rule instead of baseball's DH, and run-ahead (mercy) rules end games early more often.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does DP and Flex mean in a softball lineup?",
    a: "The Designated Player (DP) bats for the Flex player, but unlike a baseball DH, both can also play defense and swap roles during the game. On the scorecard, the DP occupies a spot in the batting order while the Flex is listed 10th and plays defense only — until the coach starts moving them around. It's the single most confusing thing in fastpitch scorekeeping.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does a backwards K mean in softball scoring?",
    a: "Same as baseball: a regular K is a strikeout swinging, and a backwards K (ꓘ) means the batter took a called third strike without swinging. The strike zone and pitching style are different in softball, but the notation is identical.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there an app that keeps softball stats for me?",
    a: "Yes. Baseball Stats Tracker works identically for softball and baseball — tap each at-bat as it happens and it builds the box score, batting and pitching stats, and spray charts automatically. It handles 7-inning games and any lineup size, for a one-time $39 purchase with no subscription.",

          How to keep score in softball
        </h1>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">By Carl Andrews · Updated July 2026</p>

        <p className="mt-6 text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
          Softball scorekeeping uses the exact same language as baseball — the same
          position numbers, the same backwards K — but the game around it is different:
          seven innings, bigger lineups, the DP/Flex rule, and mercy rules that end games
          early. This guide covers the basics fast, then the softball-specific parts that
          trip everyone up.
        </p>

        <Section title="The basics: identical to baseball">
          <p>
            Every defensive position has a number, and scorekeepers use those numbers to
            record who fielded the ball:
          </p>
          <ul className="mt-2 grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 gap-y-1 sm:grid-cols-3">
            {positions.map(([n, name]) => (
              <li key={n}>
                <strong>{n}</strong> — {name}
              </li>
            ))}
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-3">
            A ground out from shortstop to first is <strong>6-3</strong>. A fly out to
            center is <strong>F8</strong>. If you&apos;ve ever scored a baseball game,
            you already know this part — nothing changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            One wrinkle: in leagues that play with four outfielders (common in slowpitch
            and some rec fastpitch), the extra outfielder is position <strong>10</strong>.

        <Section title="What's different in softball">
          <p>
            <strong>Seven innings, not nine.</strong> Regulation fastpitch and slowpitch
            games are 7 innings (youth games are often 6 or time-limited). Your scorebook
            columns end sooner — and extra-inning tiebreakers often start with a runner
            placed on second base, which you should mark as a placed runner, not a hit.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The DP/Flex rule.</strong> Fastpitch&apos;s answer to the DH, but more
            flexible and far more confusing. The <strong>Designated Player (DP)</strong>{" "}
            bats in one of the nine batting slots; the <strong>Flex</strong> plays defense
            only and is listed tenth. Unlike a baseball DH, the DP can also play defense,
            and the Flex can be brought in to bat for the DP. Scorekeepers survive this by
            recording <em>who actually batted and what happened</em> — let the coach worry
            about the legality.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Bigger batting orders.</strong> Many youth and rec leagues bat 10, 11,
            or the entire roster instead of nine. Every extra batter needs a row in your
            book, and the wrap-around from the last batter to the first is where paper
            scorekeepers most often lose the plot.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Run-ahead (mercy) rules.</strong> Games commonly end early when a team
            leads by 15 after 3 innings, 10 after 4, or 8 after 5 (rules vary by league).
            Note the final inning clearly so the shortened game doesn&apos;t look like a
            mistake later.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Pitching is a different world.</strong> Windmill pitchers can throw
            far more innings than baseball pitchers, so one pitcher may go the whole game
            — but illegal-pitch calls (a ball awarded to the batter, runners advance) are a
            notation baseball scorebooks never need.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Scoring an inning, step by step">
          <p>Each batter gets one box per inning. For every plate appearance:</p>
          <ol className="mt-2 list-inside list-decimal space-y-1">
            <li>Write the result symbol (1B, BB, 6-3, ꓘ…) in the batter&apos;s box.</li>
            <li>Darken the diamond one base at a time as the runner advances.</li>
            <li>Fill the diamond completely when the runner scores; note the RBI on the batter who drove them in.</li>
            <li>Mark outs with a circled number (①, ②, ③) so you always know where the inning stands.</li>
            <li>Draw a diagonal line across the bottom-right of the last box when the inning ends.</li>
          </ol>
          <p className="mt-3">
            After the game, total each column: at-bats, hits, runs, RBIs, walks,
            strikeouts. That&apos;s your box score — and the pencil math is where most
            bleacher scorekeepers give up.

            Everything above works — it&apos;s how scorekeeping has been done for a century.
            But it means carrying a clipboard, doing math between innings, and hoping the
            book doesn&apos;t get left in a dugout. A scoring app replaces all of it: tap
            the result of each at-bat and the box score, season stats, and{" "}
