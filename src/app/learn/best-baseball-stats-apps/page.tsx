            Best Baseball Stats Apps in 2026
          </h1>
          <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            By Carl Andrews · Updated June 2026
          </p>

          <p className="mt-8 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            If you coach or cheer for a youth, travel, or high school baseball or
            softball team, the right stats app turns a chaotic afternoon in the
            bleachers into clean, shareable numbers — batting averages, on-base
            percentage, ERAs, and spray charts that actually help your players
            improve. But the apps vary a lot on price, depth, and how much of a
            subscription they want from you. Below are the five options worth
            considering in 2026, who each one is best for, and an honest take on
            the trade-offs.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mt-12 text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
            What to look for in a baseball stats app
          </h2>
          <ul className="mt-3 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            <li>
              <strong>Live scoring from your phone.</strong> You should be able to
              score each at-bat in real time, not enter everything afterward.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Automatic stats.</strong> AVG, OBP, SLG, OPS, ERA, and more
              should calculate themselves — no spreadsheets, no math degree.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Spray charts.</strong> Seeing where each hitter puts the ball
              is one of the most useful coaching tools at the youth level.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Real-time sync.</strong> Parents and coaches should be able to
              follow the live box score from anywhere.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Honest pricing.</strong> Subscriptions add up fast across a
              multi-season youth career. A one-time price can save hundreds.
            </li>
          </ul>

            1. Baseball Stats Tracker — best overall (no subscription)
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            <strong>The pitch:</strong> Built by a baseball parent who got tired of
            paying every month, Baseball Stats Tracker is a web app that does the
            core job extremely well for a single $39 payment. Score each at-bat live
            from your phone and it automatically calculates batting stats (AVG, OBP,
            SLG, OPS), pitching stats (IP, ERA, strikeouts, walks), interactive
            spray charts, and professional box scores — synced live so the whole
            family can follow along.

            <li>One-time $39 — no subscription, no per-team fees, no in-app purchases</li>

            <li>Interactive spray charts for every player</li>
            <li>Real-time sync across devices (refreshes about every 3 seconds)</li>
            <li>Works identically for baseball and softball, Little League through college</li>
            <li>Runs in any browser — nothing to install</li>
            <li>Free to try: score your first full game with no credit card</li>

            <li>It is a focused stats tool, not an all-in-one league platform</li>

          <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            <strong>Verdict:</strong> For most families and coaches who just want
            accurate stats without a recurring bill, this is the best value in 2026.

            <strong>The pitch:</strong> GameChanger is the most widely used youth

            video features.

            3. iScore Baseball — best for deep scorekeeping
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            <strong>The pitch:</strong> A long-standing, extremely detailed
            scorekeeping app for people who want to capture every nuance of a game.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3 font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">What it does well:</p>
          <ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            <li>Very deep, granular scorekeeping and stats</li>
            <li>One-time app purchase model (with some add-ons)</li>
            <li>Trusted by serious scorekeepers for years</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-3 font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">The short version:</p>
          <ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            <li>Steeper learning curve than newer apps</li>
            <li>Interface feels dated compared to modern web apps</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            <strong>Verdict:</strong> Great for the dedicated team scorekeeper who
            wants maximum depth and does not mind the learning curve.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mt-12 text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
            4. TeamSnap — best for team management
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            <strong>The pitch:</strong> TeamSnap is primarily a team-management
            platform — scheduling, rosters, availability, and communication — rather
            than a dedicated stats app.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3 font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">What it does well:</p>
          <ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            <li>Excellent scheduling, availability, and team messaging</li>
            <li>Great for the organizational side of running a team</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-3 font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">The short version:</p>
          <ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            <li>Stats and live scoring are not its focus</li>
            <li>Subscription-based</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            <strong>Verdict:</strong> Use it for logistics, and pair it with a
            dedicated stats app if numbers matter to you.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mt-12 text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
            5. Pen &amp; paper or a spreadsheet — best free fallback
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            <strong>The pitch:</strong> The classic scorebook (or a DIY spreadsheet)
            still works and costs nothing.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3 font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">What it does well:</p>
          <ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            <li>Free and reliable — no battery, no signal needed</li>
            <li>Full control over what you record</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-3 font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">The short version:</p>
          <ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            <li>Everything is manual — you do all the math</li>
            <li>No live sharing, no spray charts, easy to lose</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            <strong>Verdict:</strong> Fine to start, but most families upgrade to an
            app once they want shareable, automatic stats.
