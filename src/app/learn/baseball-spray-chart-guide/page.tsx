    q: "What do the colors on a spray chart mean?",
    a: "Most spray charts color-code hits by outcome. In Baseball Stats Tracker: singles are green, doubles blue, triples orange, home runs red, and outs gray. The colors let you separate 'where they hit it' from 'how well they hit it' in one picture.",

          How to read a baseball spray chart
        </h1>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">By Carl Andrews · Updated July 2026</p>

        <p className="mt-6 text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
          A spray chart turns a season of at-bats into one picture: where your hitter actually
          hits the ball. Once you can read it, you stop guessing — you know which kid pulls
          everything, who slaps it the other way, and where to stand your fielders before the
          pitch. Here&apos;s how to read one, and how to use it.
        </p>

        <Section title="What a spray chart is">
          <p>
            It&apos;s a field diagram with a dot for every batted ball, placed where it went.
            Left side of the chart is left field, right side is right field. Cluster the dots
            over a season and a pattern appears — that pattern is the whole point.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Reading location and color coding">
          <p>
            Location tells you <em>direction</em>; color tells you <em>outcome</em>. In
            Baseball Stats Tracker, singles are green, doubles blue, triples orange, home runs
            red, and outs gray. A wall of green dots to the pull side means a hitter who
            consistently pulls singles; scattered red and blue means real power to all fields.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Pull hitter vs. opposite-field hitter">
          <p>
            A right-handed hitter who sprays everything to the left side is a{" "}
            <strong>pull hitter</strong>. One who consistently goes to right field is an{" "}
            <strong>opposite-field hitter</strong>. Most youth hitters lean one way — and
            once you can see it on the chart, you can coach it and defend it.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Using it to position your defense">
          <p>
            If the chart shows a hitter pulls the ball 80% of the time, shade your infield and
            outfield toward that side before the pitch. You&apos;ll turn more of their hardest
            contact into outs — the same idea the pros use, scaled down to your field.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Using it to build the lineup">
          <p>
            Spray charts also reveal who actually drives the ball versus who just makes
            contact. Pair that with{" "}

            </Link>{" "}
            and your lineup decisions stop being guesses.
