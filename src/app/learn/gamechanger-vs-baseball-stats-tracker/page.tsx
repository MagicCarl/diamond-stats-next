  {
    q: "Is Baseball Stats Tracker better than GameChanger?",
    a: "It depends on what you need. GameChanger is better if you want video clips or your league already standardizes on it. Baseball Stats Tracker is better if you want live scoring, automatic stats, spray charts, and family sharing without a recurring subscription — it's a one-time $39 purchase.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much cheaper is Baseball Stats Tracker than GameChanger?",
    a: "Baseball Stats Tracker is $39 once, forever. GameChanger's premium features are billed on a recurring plan that families pay again every year. Over a multi-season youth career, a recurring plan typically costs several times more than a single $39 purchase — check GameChanger's site for their current rates and do the multiplication for your own timeline.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can family watch games live on Baseball Stats Tracker like GameChanger?",
    a: "Yes. Tap Share on the live scoring page and anyone with the link can follow the game in real time — live scoreboard, box score, and play-by-play — with no account and no app to install.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Baseball Stats Tracker have video like GameChanger?",
    a: "No, and that's a deliberate choice. Video streaming is the single most expensive feature to run — it's a big part of why GameChanger needs a subscription. If video clips are your priority, GameChanger is the right pick. If stats are the priority, you shouldn't have to pay yearly for them.",

          Full disclosure up front: we make Baseball Stats Tracker, and GameChanger is a
          good product — that&apos;s why your league probably uses it. This comparison is
          honest about where each app wins, because the two are built on opposite bets:
          GameChanger bundles everything (video, chat, scheduling) behind a subscription;
          we do stats exceptionally well for one payment of $39.

            The number that matters isn&apos;t this season&apos;s price — it&apos;s the
            whole youth-sports career. Kids who start at 7 and play through high school
            put in <strong>8–10 seasons</strong>. A subscription gets paid again every
            single one of those years; a one-time purchase doesn&apos;t.

            yearly is the most expensive way to get them.
