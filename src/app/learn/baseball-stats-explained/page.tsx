  {
    q: "What is a good OPS in youth baseball?",
    a: "It varies by age and level, but as a rough guide an OPS around .700 is solid, .800+ is very good, and .900+ is excellent for most youth levels. Because youth pitching and fielding are inconsistent, compare a player to their own team and league rather than to pro benchmarks.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is OBP better than batting average?",
    a: "For measuring how often a hitter helps the team, yes — OBP counts walks and hit-by-pitches, not just hits, so it reflects how often a player avoids making an out. A kid with a modest average but a great eye can have a high OBP and be very valuable at the top of the lineup.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you calculate slugging percentage (SLG)?",
    a: "Add up total bases (single = 1, double = 2, triple = 3, home run = 4) and divide by at-bats. A player with 10 total bases in 20 at-bats has a .500 slugging percentage. It measures power, not just contact.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is OPS and why do coaches use it?",
    a: "OPS is On-base Plus Slugging — you simply add OBP and SLG together. It combines getting on base and hitting for power into one number, which is why coaches use it as a quick overall measure of a hitter's value.",

          Baseball stats explained: AVG, OBP, SLG &amp; OPS
        </h1>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">By Carl Andrews · Updated July 2026</p>

        <p className="mt-6 text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
          AVG, OBP, SLG, OPS — the alphabet soup on the back of a baseball card
          confuses a lot of parents. But each one answers a simple question about a
          hitter, and once you get them, you&apos;ll understand your kid&apos;s game
          on a whole new level. Here&apos;s each stat in plain English, how it&apos;s
          calculated, and what a &ldquo;good&rdquo; number looks like in youth ball.
        </p>

        <Section title="Batting average (AVG) — the classic">
          <p>
            Batting average is hits divided by at-bats. Get 1 hit in 4 at-bats and
            you&apos;re batting .250. It&apos;s the number everyone knows — but it has a
            blind spot: it ignores walks entirely. A patient hitter who draws a lot of
            walks can look &ldquo;average&rdquo; by AVG while actually helping the team
            a lot. Useful, but never the whole story.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="On-base percentage (OBP) — why coaches love it">
          <p>
            OBP measures how often a hitter reaches base <em>any</em> way that
            isn&apos;t an out — hits, walks, and hit-by-pitches — divided by their total
            plate appearances. That&apos;s why coaches prize it: a leadoff hitter with a
            great eye and a .420 OBP creates far more scoring chances than a
            free-swinger with a shiny average and a low OBP. Getting on base is the
            whole job at the top of the order.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Slugging percentage (SLG) — measuring power">
          <p>
            Slugging weights <em>how far</em> a hitter gets, not just whether they
            reach. Add up total bases — single = 1, double = 2, triple = 3, home run =
            4 — and divide by at-bats. Two players can both hit .300, but the one
            cracking doubles and triples has a much higher slugging percentage. SLG is
            your power number.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="OPS — the one number that ties it together">
          <p>
            OPS is simply <strong>OBP + SLG</strong>. Add getting-on-base to
            hitting-for-power and you get a single, quick measure of a hitter&apos;s
            total offensive value. It&apos;s not perfect math, but it&apos;s the fastest
            honest snapshot of &ldquo;how good is this hitter,&rdquo; which is exactly
            why coaches and scouts lean on it.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="What counts as “good” at the youth level">
          <p>
            Pro benchmarks don&apos;t transfer cleanly to Little League, where pitching
            and fielding swing wildly game to game. As a rough guide, an OPS near .700
            is solid, .800+ is very good, and .900+ is excellent for most youth levels.
            The better move is to track each player against their own season and their
            own league — progress over time tells you more than any single number.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Pitching stats in one minute">
          <p>
            <strong>ERA</strong> (earned run average) is earned runs per 7 innings —
            lower is better. <strong>WHIP</strong> is walks plus hits per inning
            pitched, a measure of how many baserunners a pitcher allows.{" "}
            <strong>K/BB</strong> is strikeouts divided by walks — command in one
            number. Those three tell you most of what you need about a young pitcher.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Let the app do the math">
