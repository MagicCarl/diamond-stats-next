    q: "Is GameChanger free?",
    a: "GameChanger has a free tier that covers basic scorekeeping and live game updates. The deeper features most parents actually want — full season stats, advanced insights, and video tools — sit behind a paid plan. So it's 'free to start,' but not free for everything.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does GameChanger cost?",
    a: "GameChanger's paid plan is billed on a recurring (typically annual) basis, and the exact price changes over time — check their official site for current rates. The key thing to understand is that it's a recurring cost, so it adds up every year your child plays.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who pays for GameChanger — the team or the parent?",
    a: "It depends on the plan. Some costs are carried by the team or organization, while individual premium features are paid by parents. Families are often surprised to find the stats they want are on a personal paid plan rather than covered by the team.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a cheaper alternative to GameChanger?",
    a: "Yes. If you mainly want live scoring, automatic stats, and spray charts without a yearly bill, Baseball Stats Tracker is a one-time $39 purchase with no subscription. See our full comparison for how the two stack up.",

          GameChanger pricing in 2026: what you&apos;ll actually pay
        </h1>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">By Carl Andrews · Updated July 2026</p>

        <p className="mt-6 text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
          GameChanger is the default for a lot of youth teams — but the pricing catches
          parents off guard when the free tier stops right where the good stats begin.
          Here&apos;s the honest breakdown of what&apos;s free, what&apos;s paid, who gets
          billed, and what it adds up to across a few seasons.
        </p>

        <Section title="What GameChanger includes for free">
          <p>
            The free tier handles the basics: you can score a game, follow live updates, and
            share the gamestream with family. For a lot of casual teams, that&apos;s enough to
            get through a season — and it&apos;s genuinely useful.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="What's behind the paid plan">
          <p>
            The features most stats-minded parents actually want — full season stats,
            advanced hitting and pitching breakdowns, and the video tools — are part of a paid
            plan billed on a recurring basis. Prices change over time, so check their site for
            the current rate, but the important part is the model: <strong>it recurs</strong>.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="The real math over a youth-sports career">
          <p>
            A recurring plan can look small in April and still add up a lot by the time your
            kid has played several seasons across several years. A subscription that feels
            minor per season quietly becomes hundreds of dollars over a childhood in the game.
            That&apos;s the number worth thinking about — not the monthly or yearly sticker,
            but the total across every season you&apos;ll play.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="When GameChanger is worth it">
          <p>
            If your league standardizes on it, or you want its video and team-wide adoption,
            GameChanger earns its cost — it&apos;s a mature, polished platform. Use what your
            team mandates.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="When a one-time app makes more sense">
          <p>
            If the choice is yours and you mostly want clean stats, spray charts, and a live
            box score — without paying every year — a one-time purchase wins the long-run
            math. That&apos;s exactly why{" "}
