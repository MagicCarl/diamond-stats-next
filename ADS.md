No monthly fees. No subscriptions. Just one payment of $39 and it's yours forever.

Your kid deserves real stats. Not napkin math.

## Tips for Running These Ads

**Facebook/Instagram:**
- Ad 1 (Pain Point) works best as a static image with a photo of a messy paper scorebook next to a clean phone screen showing the app.
- Ad 2 (Competitor) works well as a simple text-on-background graphic or carousel comparing features.
- Ad 3 (Lifestyle) is strongest as a short video or Reel shot at an actual game.
- Target: Parents aged 28-55, interests in baseball, Little League, travel baseball, youth sports.
- Start with $5-10/day per ad and let them run for 5-7 days before deciding which performs best.

**Google:**
- Start with Ad Group 2 (GameChanger Alternative) — people searching for alternatives have the highest purchase intent.
- Set a daily budget of $5-10 to start.
- Use phrase match and exact match keywords, not broad match.
- Add negative keywords: "free," "MLB," "fantasy," "professional" to avoid wasted clicks.
